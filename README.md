# obsidian
### Version 1
obsidian is a bass synthesizer inspired by the sounds of artists like Great Dane, Tsuruda, and ill.Gates. 

## Voice Architecture
obsidian is a monophonic FM voice, with a hard clipper and a high feedback comb filter sandwiched between the operators. The modifiers in between mask the more traditional FM sidebands. At the output is a series of five notch filters. 

A parallel waveshaped sine sub oscillator is tuned an octave below. 


## Modulation
A chaos modulator can be assigned to the main voice architecture. 

## Some Places for Improvement
### Variable Voice Architecture
Currently the clipper, comb filter, and FM all play a part in shaping the tone of the instrument. It's a bit unintuitive, and leaves room for a more graphical way of reordering or affecting the internal gain staging. 

## Modulation Sources
They are clunky, and honestly could use some help. Maybe a macro for shaping second order modulation might be where it's at.
